ðŸŒ® Takokat: The Taco-Splosion Fiesta! ðŸ˜¼
Welcome to Takokat, a fast-paced, single-page web game where strategy meets delicious, chaotic fun! You play as Takokat, a cat who loves tacos so much that she's about to literally explode with joy (and taco fillings).

ðŸŽ® How to Play
The Goal: The objective is to create a massive, taco-filled chain reaction that engulfs all of Takokat's friends. Clear all the cats on the screen to pass the level and continue the fiesta!

Controls:

Start the Game: Click the "Start Game" button to begin a new round.

Position Takokat: At the beginning of each level, you have 10 seconds to click and drag Takokat (ðŸ˜¼) to the most strategic position on the screen. Place her carefully to maximize the chain reaction!

Watch the Fiesta: After 10 seconds, Takokat will explode in a glorious display of tortillas, lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes!

Chain Reaction: Any cat caught in the initial blast will, after a brief moment, explode themselves. The goal is to create a cascading series of explosions that clears the entire screen.

Stall Timer: Don't wait too long! If a chain reaction starts but then fizzles out for more than 5 seconds, the level ends.

âœ¨ Features
Progressive Levels: The game starts with fewer cats and gets progressively harder as you advance. Each level is a new, solvable puzzle!

Taco Scoring System: At the end of each level, you're awarded a rating of 1 to 3 tacos (ðŸŒ®) based on how quickly you clear the screen.

Dynamic Audio:

A cute, looping MIDI track plays in the background to set the festive mood.

Satisfying sound effects for explosions, chain reactions, and winning a level.

A mute button (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) to toggle all audio.

Witty Commentary: Get sassy feedback from Takokat herself! The game features a set of 10 randomly selected witty headlines on a win and 10 sassy quotes on a loss.

Fully Responsive: Optimized for both desktop and mobile play, with full touch support for dragging Takokat on any device.
